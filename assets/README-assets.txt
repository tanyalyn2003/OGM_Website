Place product photos, logo files, and favicons in this `assets/` folder.

Suggested filenames:
- `logo.png` or `logo.svg` — site logo
- `product-1.jpg`, `product-2.jpg`, `product-3.jpg` — product photos
- `favicon.ico` or `favicon-32.png`

After adding images, tell me and I will integrate them into `index.html` and update styles for better presentation.
