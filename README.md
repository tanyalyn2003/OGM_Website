# OGM_Website

This repository contains a starter static website for Olive Glass & Marble (OGM).

Local preview
- From the project root run a simple static server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or use the VS Code Live Server extension to preview `index.html`.

Next steps
- Add product photography and the brand logo into the `assets/` folder.
- Tell me any preferred colors, fonts, or copy and I will refine the design.
